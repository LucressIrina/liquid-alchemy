# Project Overview
Liquid Alchemy is a vibrant UX/UI design project for a cocktail discovery platform created entirely in Figma. The goal was to design an intuitive, visually engaging digital experience that allows users to easily explore, discover, and learn about cocktails regardless of their experience level.

The project balances strong visual storytelling with usability, focusing on clear navigation, accessibility, and scalable design structure.

# Problem
Despite growing interest in mixology, many cocktail websites are:
- Cluttered and visually overwhelming
- Difficult to navigate
- Not beginner-friendly
- Lacking clear recipe discovery paths

Users often struggle to quickly find relevant drinks or feel intimidated by complex layouts.

# Solution
Liquid Alchemy was designed around three core principles:
  1. Streamlined Navigation
  Clear information architecture enables users to browse by type, ingredient, or mood without friction.

  2. Engaging Visual Experience
  Bold color palettes, strong typography, and high-impact drink visuals create a memorable and immersive interface.

  3. Inclusive Usability
  Simple structure, readable layouts, and guided discovery support both beginners and experienced users.

The final product delivers a clean, elegant, and user-friendly experience aligned with both user needs and business goals.
